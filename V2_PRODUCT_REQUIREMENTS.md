## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

Quest Core V2 transforms professional development from a transactional platform to a transformational journey where users must **earn their Quest through story**. 

**Key Differentiators:**
- Users don't "sign up" - they begin their "story"
- 30% must earn Quest readiness (aspirational scarcity)
- Trinity evolves through time (Past → Present → Future)
- Entity-based data (no strings, only validated objects)
- Multi-voice coaching with signature transitions

**Scoring Evolution**: Legacy (6.5/10) → Current (7.6/10) → V2 (9.6/10)

## 🏔️ **Core Product Vision**

### **The Sacred Journey**
```
Story Collection → Trinity Recognition → Quest Readiness → Quest Activation
     (Act 1)           (Act 2)              (Gate)           (Begin)
```

### **Philosophy**
- **Quest**: "What drives you?" (Purpose)
- **Service**: "How do you serve?" (Value)
- **Pledge**: "What do you commit to?" (Promise)

### **Core Beliefs**
- "LinkedIn shows who you were. Quest shows who you're becoming."
- Sacred threshold: Making "not yet" an invitation, not rejection
- Story as foundation: Everything builds from authentic narrative
- Continuous Trinity evolution: Not static purpose discovery
- Professional awakening: Transformation over transaction

### **Manifesto Principles**
1. Every feature must serve the Story → Trinity → Quest journey
2. Human dignity over conversion optimization
3. Earned access creates aspiration
4. Coaches guide, users discover
5. Data serves story, not surveillance

---

## 🎭 **User Journey Architecture**

### **Act 1: Professional Mirror (3-5 minutes)**

#### **Entry Point**
- LinkedIn URL or name search
- Consent: "May we discover your professional story?"

#### **Mirror Presentation**
```typescript
interface ProfessionalMirror {
  visualization: "Timeline with floating nodes",
  messaging: "This is how the world sees you",
  corrections: "Click any node to correct our understanding",
  transparency: "Here's what we found (and might have missed)"
}
```

#### **Enhanced Discovery (Shock & Awe Strategy)**
- **Phase 1**: LinkedIn via Apify + Harvest API for company intelligence
- **Phase 2**: Tavily web search (articles, talks, GitHub)
- **Phase 3**: LinkUp market intelligence + salary benchmarking
- **Real-time Progress**: Progressive UI reveals during data gathering
- **3D Organizational Charts**: Company relationships and influence mapping

#### **Voice**: Story Coach (Female, Warm)
- "Tell me about this transition..."
- "What drew you to [field]?"
- "I notice a pattern here..."

### **Act 2: Trinity Evolution (5-7 minutes)**

#### **Trinity Through Time**
```typescript
interface TrinityEvolution {
  past: {
    quest: "What drove you then?",
    visual: "Faded constellation forming"
  },
  present: {
    quest: "What drives you now?",
    visual: "Bright, active constellation"
  },
  future: {
    quest: "What will drive you?",
    visual: "Emerging, pulsing constellation"
  }
}
```

#### **Pattern Recognition**
- AI identifies themes across timeline
- Coaches highlight evolution
- User validates or corrects

#### **Voice Transition**: Quest Coach (Male, CA/UK)
- *Signature sound effect*
- "Welcome to your Quest. I see your Trinity emerging..."
- More energetic, forward-looking

### **Act 3: Quest Readiness Gate**

#### **Assessment Algorithm**
```typescript
const readinessScore = 
  (storyDepth * 0.3) +        // How much they shared
  (trinityClarity * 0.4) +    // How clear their purpose
  (futureOrientation * 0.3);  // How ready for growth

if (readinessScore >= 70) return "QUEST_READY";
if (readinessScore >= 40) return "PREPARING";
return "NOT_YET";
```

#### **Three Outcomes**
1. **Quest Ready (70%)**: Proceed to Quest activation
2. **Preparing (25%)**: Guided exercises to clarify
3. **Not Yet (5%)**: Supportive redirection

#### **Voice**: OKR/Delivery Coach (Firm, Achievement-focused)
- "I'm taking over now. Let's make this real..."
- "Your Quest requires commitment. Are you ready?"

## 🗄️ **Data & Entity Management**

### **Entity-First Architecture**

#### **Core Principle**
Every piece of data is an entity with relationships - NO STRINGS.

#### **Entity Types**
```typescript
interface EntitySystem {
  companies: {
    verified: boolean,
    lastScraped: Date,
    parentCompany?: Company,
    subsidiaries: Company[],
    validatedBy: User[]
  },
  skills: {
    name: string,
    cluster: SkillCluster,
    parentSkill?: Skill,
    relatedSkills: Skill[],
    marketDemand: number
  },
  education: {
    institution: Entity,
    verified: boolean,
    ranking?: number,
    specialties: string[]
  }
}
```

### **Synthetic Organizations**

#### **Concept**
When scraping reveals companies/people, create "synthetic" provisional entities that users validate.

```typescript
interface SyntheticEntity {
  type: "company" | "person" | "skill",
  confidence: number,  // AI confidence in accuracy
  status: "provisional" | "validated" | "rejected",
  validators: User[],  // Users who confirmed
  created: Date,
  source: "linkedin" | "tavily" | "user"
}
```

#### **Validation Flow**
1. Scrape creates provisional entities
2. Display with transparency: "We think this is..."
3. User validates/corrects
4. Validated entities become "real"
5. Build trust network of confirmations

### **Skill Clustering & Intelligence**

#### **AI-Powered Taxonomy**
```typescript
interface SkillCluster {
  name: "Digital Marketing",
  coreSkills: ["SEO", "SEM", "Content Marketing"],
  emergingSkills: ["AI Marketing", "Voice Search"],
  parentCluster: "Marketing",
  demandTrend: "increasing",
  salaryPremium: 15  // % above base
}
```

#### **Dynamic Grouping**
- AI groups related skills automatically
- Market data informs clustering
- User corrections improve taxonomy
- Visualizations show skill relationships

### **Caching & Deduplication**

#### **Smart Rescraping**
```typescript
const shouldRescrape = (entity: Entity): boolean => {
  const sixMonthsAgo = new Date();
  sixMonthsAgo.setMonth(sixMonthsAgo.getMonth() - 6);
  
  return entity.lastScraped < sixMonthsAgo || 
         entity.majorEventFlag || 
         entity.userRequested;
};
```

#### **Deduplication Strategy**
1. Fuzzy matching on names
2. Domain matching for companies
3. LinkedIn URL as unique identifier
4. User validation for conflicts

}
```

### **AI Model Strategy** (via OpenRouter)

#### **Cost-Optimized Routing**
```typescript
const modelSelection = {
  storyCoach: "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet",     // Empathetic ($3/M)
  questCoach: "openai/gpt-4-turbo",           // Insightful ($10/M)
  deliveryCoach: "moonshotai/kimi-k2",        // Direct ($0.15/M)
  skillsAnalysis: "moonshotai/kimi-k2:free",  // Zero cost
  patternRecognition: "google/gemini-pro",     // Large context ($0.5/M)
  fallback: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"            // Budget option ($0.5/M)
};

// Automatic fallback on errors
const routeWithFallback = async (primary: string, fallback: string) => {
  try {
    return await openRouter.chat(primary);
  } catch (error) {
    return await openRouter.chat(fallback);
  }
};
```
