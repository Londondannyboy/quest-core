# Quest Core - AI Assistant Context

> **Context document for AI assistants working on Quest Core development**

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

Quest Core is a revolutionary professional development platform that guides users through discovering their authentic professional identity via the Trinity system: **Quest** (what drives you), **Service** (how you serve), and **Pledge** (what you commit to).

> "LinkedIn shows who you were. Quest shows who you're becoming."

### **Core Philosophy**
Built using Cole Medin's advanced context engineering methodology to create AI-powered coaching that remembers, evolves, and provides genuinely personalized guidance.

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Clerk (user management)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) - Single source of truth
- **AI & Voice**: Hume AI EVI, OpenRouter.AI (AI gateway), Zep (memory management)
- **AI Models**: GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini Pro (via OpenRouter for optimal routing)
- **Future**: Neo4j (professional relationship graphs)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with auto-fix deployment system

### **Data Architecture Decision**
**Hybrid approach with single source of truth**:

1. **PostgreSQL (Neon)** - Master repository for all user data
2. **Zep** - Conversational memory and behavioral insights
3. **Neo4j** (future) - Professional relationship graphs
4. **Clerk** - Authentication (master user ID source)

## 🎯 **Trinity System**

### **The Three Eternal Questions**
1. **Quest** - "What drives you?" (Purpose and motivation)
2. **Service** - "How do you serve?" (Unique contribution to others)
3. **Pledge** - "What do you commit to?" (Promises and accountability)

### **AI Coaching Architecture**
Multi-coach system with specialized AI agents:
- **Master Coach**: Orchestrator and final authority
- **Career Coach**: Long-term strategy and market positioning
- **Skills Coach**: Technical development and competency building
- **Leadership Coach**: Management and interpersonal growth
- **Network Coach**: Professional relationships and networking

## 🗂️ **4-Layer Repository System**

### **Privacy Model**
- **Surface Repo**: Public LinkedIn-style profiles
- **Working Repo**: Selective portfolio with controlled access
- **Personal Repo**: Private goals, notes, development tracking
- **Deep Repo**: AI insights, Trinity analysis, system-managed

## 🔄 **Current Development Status**

## 🛠️ **Development Guidelines**

### **Code Style**
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Component-based React architecture
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prisma ORM for database operations

### **Key Commands**
```bash
npm run dev              # Development server
npm run build            # Production build (includes Prisma generation)
npm run lint             # ESLint checking
npm run type-check       # TypeScript validation
```

### **Database Operations**
```bash
npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma db push       # Push schema changes
npx prisma studio        # Database GUI
```

## 🔑 **Environment Variables**

### **Required Services**
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL connection
- **Authentication**: Clerk keys (public/secret)
- **AI Gateway**: OpenRouter API key for multi-model access
- **Voice AI**: Hume AI credentials for empathic voice processing
- **Memory**: Zep API key and configuration
- **Deployment**: Vercel integration

### **AI Gateway Configuration**
```env
# OpenRouter for multi-model routing
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

# Model selection for different coaches
COACH_MODEL_MASTER=openai/gpt-4-turbo
COACH_MODEL_CAREER=anthropic/claude-3-sonnet
COACH_MODEL_SKILLS=openai/gpt-4
COACH_MODEL_LEADERSHIP=google/gemini-pro
COACH_MODEL_NETWORK=anthropic/claude-3-sonnet

# Cost optimization settings
OPENROUTER_PREFER_COST=true
OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
```

### **Configuration Files**
- `.env.local` - Local development environment
- `.env.example` - Template with required variables
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema definition

## 🎤 **Voice Coaching Integration**

### **Hume AI Setup**
- Empathic voice conversations with emotional intelligence
- Real-time coaching feedback and guidance
- Session continuity with memory preservation
- Multiple coaching modes: Trinity, Skills, Career, Wellness

### **Voice Session Flow**
1. User initiates voice session via interface
2. Hume AI processes speech and emotional context
3. System queries Zep for relevant user history
4. AI coaches provide contextual guidance
5. Session insights stored in both Zep and PostgreSQL

## 🧠 **AI Context Engineering**

### **Zep Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// User session management
const sessionId = await zep.memory.add_session({
  session_id: generateSessionId(),
  user_id: clerkUserId,  // Consistent ID across systems
  metadata: { sessionType, coach }
});

// Context retrieval
const relevantFacts = await zep.graph.search({
  user_id: userId,
  query: userMessage,
  limit: 3,
  min_score: 0.7
});
```

### **Multi-Coach Orchestration with AI Gateway**
- OpenRouter.AI for intelligent model routing per coach type
- Master Coach (GPT-4): Complex orchestration and final authority
- Career Coach (Claude-3): Strategic analysis and market insights  
- Skills Coach (GPT-4): Technical assessment and learning paths
- Leadership Coach (Gemini Pro): Interpersonal and management growth
- Network Coach (Claude-3): Relationship and networking strategy
- Cost optimization through automatic model selection

### **AI Client Abstraction Pattern**
```typescript
// AI routing with OpenRouter
const aiClient = new AIClient({
  baseURL: process.env.OPENROUTER_BASE_URL,
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY
});

// Model selection by coach type
const getCoachResponse = async (coach: CoachType, context: ZepContext) => {
  const model = selectModelForCoach(coach);
  return await aiClient.chat.completions.create({
    model,
    messages: buildCoachPrompt(coach, context),
    temperature: getTemperatureForCoach(coach)
  });
};
```

## 📊 **Data Flow Architecture**

### **User ID Strategy**
- **Master ID**: Clerk user ID used across all systems
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user with Clerk ID as primary key
- **Zep**: Uses same Clerk ID for consistency
- **Neo4j** (future): Will use Clerk ID for user nodes

### **Sync Strategy**
```typescript
// After each coaching session
const insights = await zep.memory.get_session_summary(sessionId);
await prisma.userInsight.create({
  data: {
    userId: clerkUserId,
    insights: insights.key_points,
    trinityUpdates: insights.extracted_trinity,
    sourceSystem: 'zep'
  }
});
```
