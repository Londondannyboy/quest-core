## 🏗️ Data Architecture Strategy

### **Hybrid Architecture Decision (December 2024)**
**Single Source of Truth**: PostgreSQL (Neon) maintains all permanent user data
**Specialized Systems**: Zep for conversational memory, Neo4j for relationship graphs

### **AI Gateway Integration with OpenRouter**
- **Multi-Model Routing**: Access to 300+ AI models through unified API
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatic selection of most cost-effective model per use case
- **Coach Specialization**: Different models optimized for different coaching types
- **Reliability**: Automatic fallbacks when primary providers are unavailable
- **Performance**: OpenAI-compatible API with <25ms routing overhead

### **Zep Integration for Conversational Memory**
- **Temporal Knowledge Graphs**: Automatic extraction of entities and relationships from conversations
- **User Session Management**: Persistent memory across voice coaching sessions
- **Context Optimization**: Query only relevant facts (3-5 most relevant) instead of full history
- **Trinity Evolution Tracking**: How Quest, Service, Pledge evolve through conversations
- **Token Cost Optimization**: 60-70% reduction in LLM context tokens

### **Combined Benefits: OpenRouter + Zep**
- **Intelligent Coaching**: Right model + right context for each interaction
- **Cost Efficiency**: Model optimization + context optimization = 40-60% cost reduction
- **Enhanced Quality**: Specialized models with rich historical context
- **Scalability**: Handle increased load through intelligent routing and memory management

### **User ID Strategy**
**Master ID**: Clerk User ID used consistently across all systems
- PostgreSQL: Primary key = Clerk ID
- Zep: user_id = Clerk ID (no translation needed)
- Neo4j (future): User nodes use Clerk ID

### **Current State**
- Basic user, trinity, skills, conversations tables
- Authentication with Clerk
- Voice coaching infrastructure
- Ready for Zep integration

### **Required Schema Changes - Entity-Centric Design**

**Core Philosophy**: All professional entities (companies, skills, certificates, education) are normalized objects with unique identifiers, enabling rich relationship graphs and professional networking. The system captures **professional relationships** within each experience to power Neo4j graph visualization and conversational intelligence.

**Relationship Intelligence**: The system tracks "who worked with whom" on projects, "who reported to whom," "who taught whom," and "who delivered what for whom" - enabling powerful network analysis and conversational coaching insights.
